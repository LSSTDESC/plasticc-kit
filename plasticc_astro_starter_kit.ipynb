    "This Project Jupyter notebook provides an introduction to some of the astrophysics that might be relevant for the \"Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge\" (PLAsTiCC) on Kaggle. It's intended to provide some domain knowledge to data scientists taking part in the challenge, and may even prove useful to some of the astronomers competing. You can use it <a href=\"https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46\">as you would a regular Jupyter notebook</a> or as a slide show with the <a href=\"https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/index.html\">RISE</a> notebook extension and clicking the <img src=\"media/RISE_button.png\" align=\"vertical-align:middle:\" width=\"5%\"> button.\n",

    "Because of the length of the notebook (there's a fair bit to cover!), the slide show will likely be a gentler introduction, though there are points in the regular notebook view that are skipped over entirely in the slide show.

    "While there's no practical way to cover all of the background astrophysics in a single Jupyter notebook, there should be enough relevant material to tackle the challenge. You can also safely ignore it and dive right in and do things your own way. Astrophysics is interesting stuff though, and if you are curious and want to know more about something, or how to do something that isn't covered here then just ask! You'll find us on the Kaggle forum for this challenge! \n",

The SAO needed a way to keep track of Sputnik's orbits but the reference for the Julian date was so far in the past that the numbers were too large for their VAX/VMS system to handle. So they did the simple thing and made the reference date of the VAX/VMS system the same as the reference date for their new time system - creatively named the \"Modified Julian date\" - and consequently, most of astronomy. This date is conveniently 2400000.5 - the extra 0.5 because the VAX reference starts at midnight, while the Julian Date starts from noon.)"

Consequently, we also give you an estimate of the 68% uncertainty on the photometric redshift (which itself might be inaccurate...) - `hostgal_photoz_err`. Be warned though that the actual photometric redshift distribution is asymmetric, and the redshift is not likely to be less than zero, so you might want to treat it as just a weight. Why is the redshift unlikely to be less than 0... we'll get to that in a bit.\n",

There's a few because we simulate occasionally getting lucky and finding a new source in a galaxy which already had spectroscopy, but the vast majority of them will be `NaN`. You could potentially try to use the training set, together with the subset of the test data that does have both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts to make a better redshift predictor if you like, or you could ignore it altogether.\n",

We know how to separate extragalactic and galactic sources pretty well, so we simulate this ability by setting the redshifts of galactic sources to exactly `0`.
